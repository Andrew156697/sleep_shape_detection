## Configuration

This add-on requires six parameters for configuration:

1. **Camera Index (`camera_index`)**: Specify the camera index (integer from 0 to 10). This corresponds to the connected USB or built-in camera.
   
2. **Authentication Parameters**: For data storage and visualization, you'll need the following details:
   - **`my_token`**: Your InfluxDB authentication token.

   - **`my_org`**: Your organization name in InfluxDB.
   - **`my_url`**: The InfluxDB instance URL (e.g., `https://us-east-1-1.aws.cloud2.influxdata.com/192.168.xxx.xxx`).
   - **`my_duration (senconds)`**: Sampling interval in seconds for collecting data points (minimum = 60).

To obtain these details:
